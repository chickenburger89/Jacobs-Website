                        Play as Lucky, an adventure-seeking cat on the hunt for riches in this 3D platformer. Lucky must
                        navigate through increasingly challenging obstacles and face dangerous enemies who stand in his
                        way. He can expand his repertoire of platforming skills by trading collectibles with various
                        NPCs along the way. Delve into a flooded castle, using its system of valves to pump the water
                        out bit by bit, revealing new secrets and paths as you lower the water level.

                        <br><br>This was made using Unreal Engine 5 with a team of myself and five others. I designed
                        and built the first level, and helped with the development of the second and third. Eventually,
                        we want to have a handful of levels that each pose new and interesting platforming challenges.

                        Laura and I challenged ourselves to recreate a game we had built before but with improved
                        graphics and gameplay. It features multiple selectable stages, toggleable music, and a
                        persistent high-score list.

                        Recreating the gameplay of the original game was a fairly easy challenge to overcome. We knew
                        roughly how we wanted it to play and feel, and we had learned how to research and utilize a
                        javascript library, so we made use of P5.play. In the last game, we did not use any libraries
                        and so had to program the gameplay from scratch. Using P5.play was not only easier to develop
                        with, but resulted in far technically superior gameplay.

                        library. The goal of this assignment was to utilize JSON data to create a visualization of some
                        kind. When browsing the different datasets to use for the project, I found the Pokemon one and
                        decided to create something around that. It was easy to make a program that sorts and prints the
                        list of Pokemon, but where I really wanted to challenge myself was making the image of the
                        Pokemon appear and the sound of its cry play when you click on the names. I have loved Pokemon
                        since I was a kid, and I wanted to create a project that reflected that. Even though I struggled
                        a bit, I was committed to creating a project I am very proud of.

                        upon my ideas which resulted in the final experience. Doing this helped me become intimately

                        class. The assignment emphasized fundamental skills such as properly using CSS, choosing
                        appropriate fonts and colors, and producing a layout that makes the user experience smooth and
                        easy. I enjoyed working on this project and I learned a lot doing so. This was the first major
                        assignment we had to work on, and it built upon the skills we had been learning up to that point
                        in the class. One challenge I faced was making the gallery section, as it required multiple
                        pages that are carefully interlinked. Although it was not technically required, I wanted to do
                        so to challenge myself and learn a little bit more about HTML.
