                    <p class="mt-3 about-text">
                        I was born August 24, 1997 in Vallejo, California. I’ve lived in various locations around the
                        state for my entire life, but I have been a Bay Area local since 2010. I am going to graduate
                        from CSU East Bay in Hayward at the end of 2024 with my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Interaction and
                        Game Design. My interests have always been of a technical nature. My hobbies involving video
                        gaming and computer hardware have developed into a vested interest in software development and
                        user experience design,
                        and how said user experience can affect the way people think or act.<br><br>On top of a genuine
                        love for games and interactivity, I use my technical knowledge and
                        skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, UX/UI Design, Adobe Suite, Unreal Engine, and other programs to
                        complete
                        any project I set out for. I enjoy working on things that challenge me to either hone my prior
                        skills or learn something new. I am committed to creating the best possible user
                        experiences down to the smallest details.

                    <p class="about-text-2">From a young age, I have always loved to learn thanks to my parents. They
                        taught me to appreciate and ask questions about the world around me, which translates into the
                        unquenchable desire to create meaningful experiences I have today. I have an older sister, an
                        older brother, and a younger sister. Aside from my technical interests, my passion also lies in science and
                        nature; the complexities of our world will never fail to amaze and inspire me. Moreover, I enjoy
                        building and painting model kits in my free time, as it allows me to be creative and hands-on
                        while also having a social aspect of sharing with friends. I also enjoy revisiting my favorite
                        stories. Some of my favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings, Goodfellas, and Shrek among many others. My favorite shows include Dragon Ball, Star
                        Trek: The Next Generation, The Sopranos, and more.

                    <p class="about-text">From the day I was old enough to pick up a controller, video games have held a
                        special place in my heart. There is something undeniably profound and deeply satisfying about
                        immersing yourself in a world with a unique set of rules and goals. That is why I have a vested
                        interest in the study of everything games; their history, their design, and the countless
                        diverse communities surrounding them. More specifically, I am interested in creating user
                        experiences that are immersive and engaging.
                        <br><br>Growing
                        up, I could always be whisked away to my favorite worlds and experience stories and levels from
                        games such as Pokémon, Mario, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, World of Warcraft, Portal, and
                        too many more to possibly list. Moreover, gaming cooperatively with friends in games like
                        Terraria, Minecraft, Castle Crashers, Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, and many more was a
                        highly formative bonding experience for my friends and I. I still find much comfort in games
                        both old and new, and diving deeper into the development and design of my favorite games has
                        become a passion of mine.

                <p class="about-text">My first console was a Nintendo 64 that my dad got for my brother and I, when I
                    was about 4 or 5. We have many fond memories of games like Pokémon Stadium, Super Mario 64, Donkey
                    Kong 64, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2, Goldeneye, and Turok. Like many gamers, I was enthralled by the
                    three-dimensional world and fluid gameplay of games like Mario 64 and DK64. It helped instill a love
                    for exploration in virtual worlds that I still hold today.</p>
                <p class="about-text">After the Nintendo 64, I experienced many old classics such as Pac-Man, Pong,
                    Mappy, Dig Dug, Pitfall, and more via plug-and-play consoles. I appreciate many retro games for the
                    impact they had and the simple elegance of their design in spite of technical limitations. The next
                    console my brother and I owned was a PlayStation 2. My biggest sinks on the console were Jak and
                    Daxter, Sly Cooper, and Ratchet and Clank. Jak and Daxter in particular was the first time I
                    experienced a cinematic story in a video game. I found myself in a vibrant, persistent world that
                    felt lived in and was bursting with colorful characters, on an epic quest across the land to save my
                    friend. The expressive cutscenes, the variety in levels, and the fluidity of Jak’s movement all
                    coalesced into a highly immersive and unique experience for the time. The series would go on to
                    be my own inspiration for our game Lucky and the Sunken Castle.</p>
                <p class="about-text">The first time I owned my own video game was Pokémon Ruby Version on the GameBoy
                    Advance, and I would go on to play every main series Pokémon game to be released thereafter. Its
                    wondrous world taught me to be myself and find joy in the mundane, and it was my first time playing
                    a game that involved more strategy versus reflexes. Every so often, I still find enjoyment in going
                    back to those older games and trying them again with an all new team. Nostalgia aside, I believe the
                    teambuilding and strategic turn-based combat of Pokémon was a triumph in both art direction and game
                    design for all the endless variety it offers.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 px-3">
                    <p class="about-text">It was around the time when my family got a PlayStation 3 that I began to
                        notice the conscious design behind everything I was seeing in games, and I started paying
                        attention to the difference between games that I thought were good and bad. What circumstances
                        lead to “bad” games? How do you make a “good” game? Is it something I can do? I still ask myself
                        these broad questions regularly. I played many of the classics from that generation such as
                        Uncharted, The Last of Us, Assassin’s Creed IV, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Skyrim, and more.
                        Games were becoming more complex just as I was becoming more analytical and intrigued by them.
                        Around this time, I attended ID Tech Camp at Santa Clara University; a summer program for kids
                        to learn how to make simple video games. I made a 2D side scrolling shooter that has
                        unfortunately been lost to time; it was rudimentary, but it was a great experience and my first
                        taste of game development. This is when I really started considering game design and development
                        as something I could pursue for my own career.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">The
                        family computer slowly became mine as I grinded hours away in World of Warcraft, Terraria,
                        Minecraft, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and many more. As the years went on, I still enjoyed playing
                        on consoles as I was getting into PC gaming; my current custom build is still my go-to video
                        game machine today.
