                    <p class="mt-3 about-text">
                        I was born August 24, 1997 in Vallejo, California. I’ve lived in various locations around the
                        state for my entire life, but I have been a Bay Area local since 2010. I am going to graduate
                        from CSU East Bay in Hayward at the end of 2024 with my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Interaction and
                        Game Design. My interests have always been of a technical nature. My hobbies involving video
                        gaming and computer hardware have developed into a vested interest in software development and user experience design,
                        and how said user experience can affect the way people think or act.<br><br>On top of a genuine
                        love for games and interactivity, I use my technical knowledge and
                        skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, UX/UI Design, Adobe Suite, Unreal Engine, and other programs to complete
                        any project I set out for. I enjoy working on things that challenge me to either hone my prior
                        skills or learn something new. I am committed to creating the best possible user
                        experiences down to the smallest details.

                    <p class="about-text-2">From a young age, I have always loved to learn thanks to my parents. They
                        taught me to appreciate and ask questions about the world around me, which translates into the
                        unquenchable desire to create meaningful experiences I have today. Aside from video games, I
                        enjoy science and nature as well as the exploration of other cultures. I love going to Lake
                        Tahoe because it is a treasured family vacation spot as well as a place that is very close to
                        nature. I also enjoy building and painting model kits in my free time, as it allows me to be
                        creative and hands-on while also having a social aspect of sharing with friends. I also enjoy
                        watching my favorite shows and movies. Some of my favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings,
                        Star Wars, No Country for Old Men, Goodfellas, and Shrek among many others. My favorite shows
                        include Dragon Ball, Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Sopranos, Parks and Recreation, 30
                        Rock, and more. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and engaging in discussions about
                        each of our favorite pastimes.

                    <p class="about-text">From the day I was old enough to pick up a controller, video games have
                        held a special place in my heart. There is something undeniably profound and deeply satisfying
                        about immersing yourself in a world with a unique set of rules and goals. That is why I have
                        dedicated my life to the study of everything games; their history, their design, and the
                        countless diverse communities surrounding them. More specifically, I am interested in creating
                        games and levels that provide an experience that is immersive, engaging, and fun.<br><br>Among
                        all
                        my hobbies, video games have always been my choice form of escapism.
                        I had my share of struggles growing up, but no matter how stressful things got, I could always
                        be whisked away to my favorite worlds and experience stories and levels from games such as
                        Pokemon, Mario, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, World of Warcraft, Portal, and too many more
                        to possibly list. Moreover, gaming cooperatively with friends in games like Terraria, Minecraft,
                        Castle Crashers, Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, and many more was a highly formative bonding
                        experience for my friends and I. Although the struggles of adulthood are all too real for me
                        today, I still find much comfort in games both old and new, and diving deeper into the
                        development and design of my favorite games has become a passion of mine.

            <div class="row mt-2 px-1">
                <p class="about-text">My first console was a Nintendo 64 that my dad got for my brother and I, when I
                    was
                    about 4 or 5. We have many fond memories of games like Pokemon Stadium, Super Mario 64, Donkey
                    Kong 64, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2, Goldeneye, and Turok. I distinctly remember a sense of
                    wonder, especially with regards to Mario 64; like many gamers, I was enthralled by the
                    three-dimensional world and fluid gameplay. Donkey Kong 64 was also very formative for me; the
                    vibrant world and goofy characters drew me in, and it felt like there were endless secrets to
                    discover in the game world. Although I never beat it due to its excessive length, it helped
                    instill a love for exploration in virtual worlds that I still hold today. I was enticed to
                    explore more video games and see what else among endless possibilities awaited me.</p>
                <p class="about-text">After the Nintendo 64, I experienced many old classics such as Pac-Man, Pong,
                    Mappy, Dig Dug, Pitfall, and more via plug-and-play consoles. I did not realize the importance of
                    those games back then, but I now appreciate them for the impact they had and the simple elegance of
                    their design in spite of technical limitations. The next console my brother and I owned was a
                    PlayStation 2. My biggest sinks on the console were Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, and Ratchet and
                    Clank. Jak and Daxter in particular was hugely influential to me; it was the first time I
                    experienced a cinematic story in a video game. I found myself in a vibrant, persistent world that
                    felt lived in and was bursting with colorful characters, on an epic quest across the land to save my
                    friend. The expressive cutscenes, the variety in levels, and the fluidity of Jak’s movement all
                    coalesced into a highly immersive and unique experience for the time. When I got my hands on Jak 2
                    and 3, I was further engrossed by the story of time travel, monsters, and killer robots, and I
                    thoroughly enjoyed the new gameplay elements that got added as the trilogy progressed. However, the
                    original holds a special place in my heart as it laid the groundwork for what I would consider to be
                    one of the best trilogies 3D platformers of all time. It would go on to inspire my own game, Lucky
                    and the Sunken Castle. Ratchet and Clank and Sly Cooper are also important to me; I’ll never forget
                    the countless waves of enemies I would have to face with Ratchet’s cartoonish arsenal. Conversely,
                    playing Sly Cooper was when I realized that action games don’t have to entirely revolve around
                    combat. The stealth gameplay paired with the explorable levels was intoxicating. </p>
                <p class="about-text">The first time I owned my own video game was Pokemon Ruby Version on the GameBoy
                    Advance. Although I am highly critical of Pokemon as a video game franchise today, it stems from a
                    love that began on the GBA. It is a franchise I hold incredibly dear to my heart, as I would go on
                    to play every main series Pokemon game to be released thereafter. I cannot begin to count the number
                    of adventures I have had across all of them; of all the games I played growing up, Pokemon as a
                    franchise is the one I spent the most time in. Its wondrous world taught me to be myself and find
                    joy in the mundane, and it was my first time playing a game that involved more strategy versus
                    reflexes. Every so often, I still find enjoyment in going back to those older games and trying them
                    again with an all new team. Nostalgia aside, I believe the teambuilding and strategic gameplay of
                    Pokemon was a triumph in both art direction and game design for all the endless variety it offers.

                    <p class="about-text">It was around the time when my family got a PlayStation 3 that I began to
                        realize that everything in games was consciously designed, and I started paying attention to the
                        difference between games that I thought were good and bad. What circumstances lead to “bad”
                        games? How do you make a “good” game? Is it something I can do? I still ask myself these broad
                        questions regularly. I played many of the classics from that generation such as Uncharted, The
                        Last of Us, Assassin’s Creed IV, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, and more. Games were becoming more
                        complex just as I was becoming more analytical and intrigued by them. Around this time, I
                        attended ID Tech Camp at Santa Clara University; a summer program for kids to learn how to make
                        simple video games. I made a 2D side scrolling shooter that has unfortunately been lost to time;
                        it was rudimentary, but it was a great experience and my first taste of game development. This
                        is when I really started considering game design and development as something I could pursue for
                        my own career.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">As the years went on, I still enjoyed playing on consoles as I was getting
                        into PC gaming; my current custom built PC is still my go-to video game machine today. The
                        family computer slowly became mine as I grinded hours away in World of Warcraft, Terraria,
                        Minecraft, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and many more.
